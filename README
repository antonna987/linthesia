Linthesia is a fork of the Windows/Mac game called Synthesia. It is a game
of playing music using a MIDI keyboard (or your PC keyboard), following
a .mid file.

Synthesia up to version 0.6.1a is Open Source. This project uses the
latest source from sourceforge.

Compile
-------

To compile, you need a basic c++ toolchain, and satisfy all dependences
which are on BUILD-DEPENDS file. Then, just:

    $ autoreconf -ivf

Here you must choose:

 a) For developers

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build     # Isolate compilation to speed future compilations
    $ ../configure

 b) For general public

    $ ../configure --prefix=/usr

Then:

    $ make
    $ sudo make install


Troubleshooting
---------------

* 'no text' issue with ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5470

Setting LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE might fix the problem without any noticable adverse effects.

To run linthesia, use :

    $ LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 linthesia
